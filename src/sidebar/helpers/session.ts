/**
 * The following things must all be true for the tutorial component to auto-display
 * on app launch:
 * - The app must be operating within the "sidebar" (i.e. not single-annotation
 *   or stream mode); AND
 * - No configuration is present in `settings.services` indicating
 *   that the host wants to handle its own help requests (i.e. no event handler
 *   is provided to intercept the default help panel), AND
 * - A user profile is loaded in the current state that indicates a `true` value
 *   for the `show_sidebar_tutorial` preference (i.e. the tutorial has not been
 *   dismissed by this user yet). This implies the presence of a profile, which
 *   in turn implies that there is an authenticated user.
 *
 * @param isSidebar - is the app currently displayed in a sidebar?
